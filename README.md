# EvilLogger
this is just a simple token logger i made in like 2 hours

to use it create a webhook on your discord server you want the commands to log to 
copy the webhook URL and paste it into where it says (input-your-webhook-here)

and paste the webhooks token into where it says to enter the token 

create a .py or .js file and have fun logging
